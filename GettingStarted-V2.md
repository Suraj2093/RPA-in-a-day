1. It is recommended to name your gateway as **Your computer name gateway**. Create a **recovery key**, then click **Configure**.
   
   > ***Note*** : the gateway region must match the region of the Power Automate environment that being used in this lab. (The environment that you created earlier, or the one your instructor asks you to use for this class. Check with your instructor if you are not sure which region the gateway should match to. By default, the gateway installer will automatically configure to use the same region as the default environment of the tenant you are using. If you must change the Gateway to a different region, click the fine text of “Change Region” as shown in the last line in the setup page below. Note, if you already finished install the gateway, but mistakenly installed to the wrong region, to switch to a different region, you have to uninstall the gateway from “Add and remove program” and reinstall the gateway.

1. Now your gateway is ready to be used. Click **Close**.

1. Click on **Contoso Invoicing** icon on the lab VM desktop to launch *Contoso Invoice App*. We will use this app for both the Process advisor and Robotic Processing Automation recordings.

   > ***Note*** : you will need to click “More Information” and “Run it anyway” during installation of the Contoso app if Windows Defender prompts you that the app is coming from untrusted source

1. Now we can get familiar with Contoso Invoice App so we can better prepare for the following lab recording exercises

   * Open Contoso Invoice App
   * Click Invoices

   ![](images/invoice-1.png)

1. Click **New record** button on the left to create a new invoice.

Once this is completed you can proceed with the lab using the lab guide. The rest of the exercises are available in the lab VM at ***C:\RPAIAD\RPAinADay-Student\lab manuals in pdf***, you can start from **Lab 2 How to generate insights to optimize and automate your process using process advisor**.
